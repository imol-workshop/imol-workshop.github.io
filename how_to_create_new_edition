This doc explains how to create a new edition of the website while embedding the previous ones inside

# create the current site
first jekyll serve the current edition you care about with  bundle exec jekyll serve
then stop the serving
this will create the current full website into _site folder

# update website name
rename the site_prev_year folder into site_new_year
change the source parameter in config.yml into site_new_year

# embed the old website
copy _site (copy of the old site) into site_new_year/site_old_year
you now need to update a couple stuff in the html files of site_old_year
in particular site_old_year/index.html and all the pages/page_name/index.html files
what you need to update:
the three css lines should be:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/site_old_year/assets/css/bootstrap-social.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/site_old_year/assets/css/beautifuljekyll.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/site_old_year/css/common.css">
the nav links should be:
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="/site_old_year">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="/site_old_year/pages/speakers">Speakers</a>
    </li>
and you need to add a link to the current website by adding one tab:
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="/">Current Edition</a>
    </li><li class="nav-item">
you basically need to update all /assets/ links in these files into /site_old_year/assets/, like all links to pictures!

the above things ensure that tab links and css files used in the old website will point to the old website and not the new one.

# ok now your new website needs to point to the old ones
you can add a new tab with links to each of the past events if several
i currently have just one past event so the tab links directly routes there: site_old_year/index.html
