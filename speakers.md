        Michael Tomasello is Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University and emeritus Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.  His research interests focus on processes of social cognition, social learning, and communication/language in human children and great apes. </p>

        Modern theories explain children’s cognitive development mainly in term of Bayesian learning (with some innate priors in infancy). But learning cannot be the whole story or else children could learn anything at any age - which they cannot. They cannot because their capacities to experience and cognitively represent the world are structured by the human species’ evolved psychological architecture - inherited from ancient animal ancestors - and this architecture changes in significant ways over the first years of life. The main organizing principle is agency, including shared agency. The developmental proposal is that young infants (below 9 months) are goal-directed agents who cognitively represent and learn about actualities; toddlers are intentional agents who executively represent and learn also about causal, intentional, and logical possibilities; and preschoolers (over 3 years) are metacognitive agents who metacognitively represent and learn also about normative necessities. This agency-based model of cognitive development recognizes the important role of learning, but at the same time places it in the context of the overall agentive organization of children at particular developmental periods.

        Georg Martius is a full professor at the University of Tübingen in Computer Science since 2023. He is also leading a research group on Autonomous Learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. Before joining the MPI in Tübingen, he was a postdoc fellow at the IST Austria and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen and his computer science degree from University of Leipzig. His research focus is on machine learning for robotics, including internal model learning, reinforcement learning, intrinsic motivations, representation learning, differentiable combinatorial optimization and haptics.

        I will summarize research in the area of intrinsic motivation in the context of learning and exploration and touch upon open-ended learning in the IMOL community. I will then present our recent work on combining different intrinsic motivation signals with reinforcement learning, such as learning progress, causal influence and information gain. A particular exciting direction is to employ model-based reinforcement learning to make robots learn by freely playing how to interact effectively driven by information gain and other generic drives. We find that this leads to high zero-shot generalization to new tasks.

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Princeton University. My lab studies the cognitive capacities and community dynamics that make human collaboration possible. We approach collaboration at two levels of analysis. Zooming in, our work seeks to understand how individuals navigate collaborations—that is, how individuals learn about their collaborators, share knowledge with one another, and divide labor. Zooming out, our work examines how community-wide dynamics contribute to the success of collaborations. Outside of the lab, I draw <a href="https://nataliavelez.org/sketches/"> portraits </a> of scientists alongside their science.         </p>
